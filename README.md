My learning journey of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (work in progress)

## Thoughts on starting this learning journey

Back before I started programming,  I was introduced to a website for programmers to test their skills called LeetCode, which provides coding interview questions for coders
to try out. Curious, I went to look at the questions and found myself overwhelmed by how bizzare the questions look. I took a look around the internet to see how people solve
LeetCode questions and realised they understood this important programming concept that I haven't touched before - Data Structures and Algorithms.

Hence the birth of this repository, for me to bridge this gap.

(Funnily enough, when I first looked at LeetCode I had no idea how to navigate their website. I saw they had an answer template where you can type in your code answers but 
it contained many different kinds of programming languages. Obviously I went for the one I knew, Python. But then there was 2 options, Python and Python3. Then I looked at
the starting code (at the time I didn't know about Object-Oriented Programming and Classes yet) and I couldn't tell which was the one I was supposed to use. Furthermore, I 
was literally unable to understand any of the questions and give any relevant answer. So as you can see, this is how disastrous my first LeetCode experience was. (Eventually I found out I was using Python3, which I'm pretty sure is the version everyone using Python is using, after copy-pasting some of the usual codes I've written and asking ChatGPT hahaha...))

Learning and Practices are both organised under each folder for their respective Data Structure/Algorithm.
