# 14.-Common-Data-Structure-Implementations-Python

## Thoughts on starting this project
Searched the internet, however I haven't found a compilation of the various common Data Structures Python implementation. So I decided to make one for myself, or for anyone else who wish use this compilation. Of course, every version of a Data Structure implementation is slightly different in terms of how they are implemented so if you wish to use the Data Structure Python implementations in this compilation for your personal projects you might need to have a understanding on how these implementations are created so I strongly suggest you take a look at codebasics' Youtube playlist on Data Structure and Algorithms I got the Data Structure Python implementations from (here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu_n_a__MI_KktGTLYopZ12)), or from looking at the seperate repository in my Github profile '12.-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Learning-and-Practice-Python' (here's the [link](https://github.com/WindJammer6/12.-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Learning-and-Practice-Python))

Disclaimer: These Data Structures Python implementations are done by Dhaval Patel, founder of the Youtube channel [codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/@codebasics), I did not create these Data Structure Python implementations, I merely compiled them while doing some minor changes as well as added some simple Instance Methods on the Data Structure Classes. 

## Table of Contents
Here are the common Data Structure Python implementations in this compilation:
   1. Linked List Data Structures:
      + Singly Linked List Data Structure
      + Doubly Linked List Data Structure
   2. Hash Table Data Structure[Bank-related operations (bank.py)](#bankrelatedoperations)
   4. Stack Data Structure[User-related operations (user.py)](#userrelatedoperations)
   5. Queue Data Structure[Bank Database (account_database.csv)](#bankdatabase)
   6. Tree Data Structures:[Windy Banks (windy_banks.py)](#windybanks)
   7. General Tree Data Structure
   8.
